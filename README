Things of Note:
Makefile changed significantly.
Project requires bison and flex to compile (both are on standard CS machines).
Project 'translated' to C++.

To make the project works exactly the same, just type 'make'.
To run the project, either directly run the generated executable, or type
'make run'. This will compile the executable if it is not already present.
Running 'make lines' will report the total line count of the project.

Extras:
1. Both the VRML scene and the calculated cone respect the display style chosen
   for GLUT. This means if the display style is DS_WIRE, those scenes will
   display a wireframe. Press 's' to change them back to filled polygons.
2. A subset of wavefront .obj and .mtl files can be loaded. The code will
   attempt to load the model from "./data/model/model.obj" and any files that
   are included from that file.
3. The code can compile and link vertex and fragment shaders. Included shaders
   are ./data/shaders/free.vs and ./data/shaders/free.fs, which implement a
   slightly shoddy form of ADS lighting.
4. The code can load textures from png files. This is currently not used.

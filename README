Things of Note:
Makefile changed significantly.
Project requires bison and flex to compile (both are on standard CS machines).
Project 'translated' to C++.

To make the project works exactly the same, just type 'make'.
To run the project, either directly run the generated executable, or type
'make run'. This will compile the executable if it is not already present.

Extras:
1. Both the VRML scene and the calculated cone respect the display style chosen
   for GLUT. This means if the display style is DS_WIRE, those scenes will
   display a wireframe. Press 's' to change them back.
2. Project can load a subset of wavefront .obj models and .mtl material
   libraries.
   Project will load ./data/model/model.obj and any files included from it or
   children files.
3. The code can compile and link vertex and fragment shaders. Included shaders
   are ./data/shaders/free.vs and ./data/shaders/free.fs, which implement a
   slightly shoddy form of ADS lighting.
